# GatorFound

**GatorFound** is a comprehensive lost and found service tailored for students and staff at the University of Florida (UF). It provides a dedicated and efficient platform to report and search for lost or found items, replacing less effective public methods like social media. With GatorFound, users can connect in a secure and private way, ensuring quick and reliable item recovery.

## Application Summary

### Core Features

1. **Post About Lost Items**: Users can create posts describing items they’ve lost, including details like location and time to increase the chances of retrieval.
2. **Post About Found Items**: Users can report items they’ve found, enabling quick connections with the rightful owner.
3. **Comment Section**: A communication space for users to interact directly on posts, discuss item ownership, or arrange pick-ups.
4. **Login System**: A secure authentication system that ensures only UF students and staff can access the platform, requiring a valid UFL email for account creation.
5. **Centralized Hub**: The application serves as a single platform for all lost and found-related activities at UF.
6. **Privacy Focused**: By requiring UFL emails, GatorFound fosters a safer and more private community compared to using public platforms.

## Future Enhancements

Although the application is already feature-complete, the team envisions further improvements, including:
- **Admin Dashboard**: A management tool for moderators to oversee posts and comments.
- **Filtered Search**: Advanced search options to make item discovery more efficient.
- **Notification System**: Alerts for users about updates on their posts or items they may be interested in.
- **User Profiles**: A personal dashboard for tracking reported and found items.
- **Tutorials**: Guidance for new users to navigate the platform effectively.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
